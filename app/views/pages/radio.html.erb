<h2>A Radio Ministry of MDN</h2></br>
<p>"A New Kind of Man" radio program is a new ministry of Men's Discipleship Network. It is our prayer that this radio program will reach the millions of Christian men who are not living out their fullest potential in Christ. Many of them living in quiet desperation and at a loss in knowing how to live "the Abundant Life" that Jesus spoke about in John 10:10.</p></br>
<p>Each episode will provide our listening audience with scriptural challenges, biblical truths, and rich parables to illustrate Godly character and to provide the "training to sustain" a man in his Christian walk. Every program will introduce one message and one application that a man can immediately put into practice in their lives "Tuesday at 2 o'clock".</p></br>
<p>Join us <span style="font-weight:bold">Saturday mornings at 9am on WLIX FM (see coverage map below) </span>as Head Coach Scott Caesar calls out the men of the Northeast to spiritual maturity and masculinity in Christ.</p></br>
