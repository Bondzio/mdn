	<h2 id="gala">Men's Discipleship Network Inaugural Gala</h2>
	<p>Come and share in MDN's plans to transform men for Christ and to "Change families one man at a time." See Alex Kendrick, author, director, and star of <a href="http://www.courageousthemovie.com">new movie Courageous</a>, speak about the importance of challenging and discipling men to live for Christ. Hear testimony about the tremendous fruit that this ministry has had in the Northeast over the past year and find out how you can partner with us as we move into the next phase that we believe the Lord has called us to. Enjoy a good meal and be inspired by the movement of God's Spirit in one of the most notoriously, unchurched areas of America.</p></br>
	<p>The Gala will be held at the Long Island Marriott. Tickets are $125 per seat or $1000 for a table of 10 seats. To reserve your seats contact Paula DiBernardo at 631-753-1244 or email her at <a href="mailto:paula@mensdiscipleshipnetwork.com?&subject=MDN Inaugural Gala">paula@mensdiscipleshipnetwork.com.</a></p></br><a href="#events">Back to top</a> &uarr;</br></br>
