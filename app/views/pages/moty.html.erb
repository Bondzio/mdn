			 Dr. Edwin Louis Cole, the "father of the Christian men’s movement”
		Dr. Cole established a heritage that will influence generations, launched from a mission statement that propelled his life and ministry: “I have been called to speak with a prophetic voice to the men of this generation and commissioned with a ministry majoring in men to declare a standard for manhood, and that standard is that ‘Manhood and Christ-likeness are Synonymous.” </p><%= image_tag("moty/girardi.jpg", :alt => 'Joe Girardi with Pastor Scott Caesar in his early days of ministry', :class => 'image_float_rt')%>

		<p>On November 17, 2016, we will be celebrating our 20th year anniversary with a fundraising gala at The Inn at New Hyde Park. We are honored and privileged to have as our keynote speaker, Joe Girardi, Manager of the New York Yankees. This is a double honor as Joe spoke at our first event 20 years ago. Additionally, we will be presenting the Edwin Louis Cole Man of the Year Award given in recognition to a man who has positively influenced the church, his family and community.</p>

		<p>We would like to ask for your prayerful consideration of involvement in helping in the process of nominating a man for this honorable award. The late Dr. Edwin Louis Cole was a friend and mentor who shaped and molded MDN’s Founder, Scott Caesar as a Men’s Pastor. We continue his legacy by standing in the gap as advocates for Christian men, not ceasing until revival through ministry to men takes place in our region.</p><%= image_tag("moty/moty_award.jpg", :alt => 'Photo of the Doctor Edwin Louis Cole man of the year award.', :class => 'image_float_lft')%>
