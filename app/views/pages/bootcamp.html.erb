        <p>MDN’s Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup> is a powerful, often life changing event in which men from all over the region come together to be challenged by the Word of God delivered through engaging, powerful, and inspired speakers and pastors. You will experience the power of brotherhood with men who share one common bond: Jesus Christ. Come as you are. There are none perfect here (Romans 3:10); just men recognizing their need of the Savior and a desire to become more like Him. Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup>  is fun. You will laugh until you cry, and you will cry until you laugh as you experience the grace of Christ in your life. Come and be among the multitude of men called by God to gather "for such a time as this”. Come! Be “The Man God Blesses”.</p>
