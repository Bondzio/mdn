	<h1>Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup></h1></br>
	<h2>March 29, 2014</h2>
	<p>Location: Smithtown Gospel Tabernacle</br>
	1 Higbie Drive </br>
	Smithtown, NY 11787</p>
<br />
	<h1>Thank You!</h1>
	<p>Well, another incredible Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup> event was conducted on March 29th. If you were present, you witnessed an amazing move of God as His Holy Spirit moved among the hearts of the men who came out to this sold out event. Men worshipped the Creator together in unity from scores of different churches representing dozens of denominations across the New York Metro region. Men of every color locked arms in racial solidarity to the cause of Christ, and were challenged to the core of their being to stand firm for righteousness and to influence our culture for God, so that by His grace we may see revival in our land.</p>
	<p>Special thanks goes to Pastor Gary Zarlengo, Pastor Derek Prezzano, the SGT Staff, and the faith family of Smithtown Gospel Tabernacle for their incredible generosity, hospitality, and cooperation in conducting this event. There is no way that MDN could have delivered this event were it not for the local church like SGT sharing their facilities and resources. We pray that the Lord continues to bless SGT with God's favor for the impact they have on all the churches and communities in the region.</p>

		<p>Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#174;</sup> is an event that challenges a man to the depth of his being, confronting him with the realization of the Holy God, the great inadequacy of the workings of his flesh, and the hope that exists only through Jesus Christ and in living out the plan God has for him as the head of his family, leader in his church, and provider.</p>
