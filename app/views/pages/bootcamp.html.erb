<h1>Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#153;</sup></h1></br>
<p>Isaiah saw God and was suddenly confronted with the profound realization of God's glory and the instant dread of realizing his own shortcoming before the Righteous Judge. He cried...</p></br> <p><span style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 10px; text-indent: -10px;">“Woe to me!”... “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.” </p></span> Isaiah 6:5  </p></br>
<p>Like Isaiah, we live among a people of "unclean lips" in a culture that is increasingly corrupt and anti-Christ. Men can't help but to be exposed to this culture, but they don't have to be overcome by it.</p></br>
	
<p>Discipleship Boot Camp<sup>&#153;</sup> is an event that challenges a man to the depth of his being, confronting him with the realization of the Holy God, the great inadequacy of the workings of his flesh, and the hope that exists only through Jesus Christ and in living out the plan God has for him as the head of his family, leader in his church, and provider.</p>
