<p>Men's Discipleship Network's 4 Phase system of discipleship includes having MDN trained Coaches working along side your 
	church's Pastor or Men's Leader to train him on how to minister to the unique needs of Men. If you would like to request an 
	MDN Coach, and you are the Pastor or Men's Leader of your church, please use the form below to submit your request.
	We will contact you within 48 hours to discuss your request.</p><br />
	
<p>Thank you for your request. Remember, men don't get what they wish for...they get what they Prepare, Train, and Live for!</p><br />
